     UIKit independent behaviours:
     `UIImage` is just being passed as a data packet only, and hence referred from `UIKit` module here.
     Technically, we could have passed a different type, such as  raw`Data` (or maybe `CGIImage`) here to avoid `UIImage` type.
     The core of this presenter logic is still `UIKit` <events/controls/delegates etc.> independent .
